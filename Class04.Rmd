```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#here we have global settings for all the chunks
```

## R Markdown



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r load-package, message=FALSE}
#r space name of the chunk comma instructions and arguments separated by a comma
library(tidyverse)

storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(wind = mean(wind)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = wind)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```
